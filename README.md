Visibility graphs for robust harmonic similarity measures between audio spectra

This code accompanies the paper "Visibility graphs for robust harmonic similarity measures between audio spectra" by Delia Fano Yela, Dan Stowell and Mark Sandler, where we introduce the visibility graph for audio spectra and propose to use a structural distance between two graphs as a novel harmonic-biased similarity measure.

In the paper we present two experiments demonstrating the utility of the proposed representation of audio signals for harmonic similarity measure.

Experiment 01 for synthesised audio data:
 - Audio data used: AUDIO/synth_dataset
 - Script to run experiment: experiment01.py
 - Script to plot the results (Figure 3 in the paper): plot_exp01.py

Experiment 02 for real audio data:
- Audio data used: DSD100 dataset available at https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/dsd100.html
- Script to run experiment: experiment02.py
- Script to plot the results (Figure 3 in the paper): plot_exp02.py


Other:
- plot_representation.py : Script to plot Figure 2 of the paper showing an example of a spectrogram and its corresponding spectral visibility graph degree proposed representation. The sample audio can be found in AUDIO/sample_used_plot_representation

- visibility_algorithms.py : our implementations of the different visibility graphs algorithms.

- figures : folder containing the images used in the paper

- results_experiments : folder containing the results (in form .csv) obtained from the experiments scripts and used by the plotting scripts.
